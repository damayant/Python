The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is useful when you have a superclass with multiple subclasses, and the specific subclass to be instantiated is determined at runtime.

Here's a general code template for the Factory Method Pattern in Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Creator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def factory_method(self):
        pass
    
    def some_operation(self):
        product = self.factory_method()
        result = f"Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with {product.operation()}"
        return result

class ConcreteCreator1(Creator):
    def factory_method(self):
        return ConcreteProduct1()

class ConcreteCreator2(Creator):
    def factory_method(self):
        return ConcreteProduct2()

class Product(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def operation(self):
        pass

class ConcreteProduct1(Product):
    def operation(self):
        return "{Result of ConcreteProduct1}"

class ConcreteProduct2(Product):
    def operation(self):
        return "{Result of ConcreteProduct2}"
```

Now let's look at five real-life practical application examples of the Factory Method Pattern in Python:

1. **Document Generation System**:
   Suppose you have a document generation system that can generate various types of documents like PDFs, Word documents, and HTML documents. You can use the Factory Method Pattern to define a DocumentCreator superclass with methods to create different types of documents and concrete subclasses like PdfCreator, WordCreator, and HtmlCreator to create specific types of documents.

2. **Payment Gateway Integration**:
   When integrating with multiple payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Square), each with its own implementation details, you can use the Factory Method Pattern to create payment gateway objects dynamically based on the selected payment method.

3. **GUI Framework**:
   In a GUI framework where you have different types of UI elements like buttons, text fields, and dropdowns, you can use the Factory Method Pattern to create UI element objects based on user input or configuration.

4. **Vehicle Manufacturing**:
   In a vehicle manufacturing system, you can use the Factory Method Pattern to create different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles) based on customer requirements or production line constraints.

5. **Plugin System**:
   When developing a plugin system for an application where you want to support custom plugins, you can use the Factory Method Pattern to create plugin objects dynamically based on the type of plugin selected or configured.

Now, let's discuss when to use and when not to use the Factory Method Pattern, along with common mistakes:

**When to Use:**
- Use the Factory Method Pattern when you have a superclass with multiple subclasses and the specific subclass to be instantiated is determined at runtime.
- Use it when you want to delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to subclasses.
- Use it when you want to decouple the client code from the concrete classes.

**When NOT to Use:**
- Do not use the Factory Method Pattern when there's only one concrete class to be instantiated.
- Do not use it when the creation logic of objects can be handled by simple conditional statements without the need for subclasses.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Overcomplicating the design by creating unnecessary subclasses or abstract classes.
- Violating the Single Responsibility Principle by mixing object creation logic with other responsibilities in the factory method or concrete subclasses.
- Failing to properly encapsulate object creation logic, leading to tight coupling between the client code and concrete classes.

Overall, the Factory Method Pattern is a powerful tool for creating objects in a flexible and decoupled manner, but it should be used judiciously and appropriately in situations where it provides clear benefits in terms of flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.
