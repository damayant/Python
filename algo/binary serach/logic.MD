Understanding when to use `while(left < right)` versus `while(left <= right)` in binary search is crucial and depends on the nature of the problem you're solving. Here’s a detailed explanation with examples:

### `while (left < right)`

This condition is used when you need to narrow the search space to a single element, and you’re confident that the answer lies strictly within the bounds defined by `left` and `right`. 

#### Example Problem: Find Peak Element (LeetCode 162)

**Problem Statement:**
Given an array `nums`, where `nums[i] != nums[i+1]`, a peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Find a peak element and return its index. You may imagine that `nums[-1] = -∞` and `nums[n] = -∞`. The array may contain multiple peaks; in that case, return the index to any one of the peaks.

**Solution Using `while (left < right)`**:
```python
def findPeakElement(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
            right = mid  # The peak is in the left part including mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # The peak is in the right part excluding mid
    return left
```
- **Reasoning**: 
  - We want to find any peak, and we are confident there’s at least one peak.
  - If `nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`, the peak must be on the left side or at `mid`.
  - If `nums[mid] <= nums[mid + 1]`, the peak must be on the right side, excluding `mid`.
  - The loop condition `left < right` ensures we narrow down to a single element.

### `while (left <= right)`

This condition is used when you need to ensure all possible elements are considered, including the case where `left` and `right` may point to the same element, which is necessary when you need to include every element in the search range.

#### Example Problem: Binary Search (LeetCode 704)

**Problem Statement:**
Given a sorted array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

**Solution Using `while (left <= right)`**:
```python
def search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
- **Reasoning**: 
  - We are searching for a specific target value, and we need to ensure every element in the array is considered.
  - If `nums[mid]` equals the target, we return the index.
  - If `nums[mid] < target`, search in the right half (excluding `mid`).
  - If `nums[mid] > target`, search in the left half (excluding `mid`).
  - The loop condition `left <= right` ensures that when `left` equals `right`, the element at `mid` (which is equal to `left` and `right`) is still considered.

### Summary

- Use `while (left < right)` when you are narrowing down the range to a single element and confident that the answer lies within the current bounds. This approach usually modifies the search range in a way that the loop stops when `left` equals `right`.
- Use `while (left <= right)` when you need to consider every element in the search range, including cases where `left` and `right` might converge on the same element. This is essential when you cannot be sure the answer lies strictly within the bounds.

Choosing the correct condition depends on understanding the problem constraints and how the search space is being reduced in each iteration.
